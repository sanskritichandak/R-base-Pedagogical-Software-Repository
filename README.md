# R-base-Pedagogical-Software-Repository

Presented at the Joint Mathematics Meet 2022

Project Overview 

- Open-source R-based pedagogical software repository
- Project-based learning for regression analysis, Bayesian statistics, clustering analysis, and neural network analysis

Introduction
Literature Review
- Backwards Design Learning Project Focus
- Real World Application

Implementation
- Incorporating Project-Based Learning Open-Source
- Examples

Backwards Design Learning 
- Backwards Design Learning places an emphasis on setting learning goals for teaching statistics.
- Objectives include overcoming statistics anxiety, applications of inferential statistics, and active learning through student-led data gathering.
- This technique allows statistics courses to have a project-based focus on real-world applications.

Project Focus 
- Inquiry guided learning whereby educators facilitate the learning process among students.
- Analysis projects are designed to guide holistic integration of research skills and analysis into the undergraduate curriculum.
- The use of R is increasingly prominent across various disciplines and alleviates the barrier of sharing resources and distributing knowledge in classrooms.

Real-World Applications
- Research projects help promote awareness and literacy, appreciation of statistical methodology, and technical skills for real-world applications.
- Modern-day statistics courses integrate pedagogical frameworks using cutting-edge technology.
e.g. analyzing income trends for various degrees, results of a news poll or election, etc.

Incorporating Project-Based Learning 
- Creating research questions to tell stories
- Using real-life events to connect with students
- Communication to audiences without statistical backgrounds

Open-Source Resources 
- GitHub, Stack-Overflow, YouTube
- Statistical Explanation vs. Procedural Computation
- Being an adaptable, content enhancing tool

Looking Forward 
- Compilation of a year-long statistics course - currently in development stage
- Frequentist Approach
- Big Data Approach
- Providing students and faculty with access through GitHub
